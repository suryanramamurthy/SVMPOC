/**
* Fast pair algorithm: hybrid of conga line and nearest neighbors.
* This is based on the observation that the conga line data structure, in practice, does better 
* the more subsets you give to it: even though the worst case time for k subsets is O(nk log (n/k)), 
* that worst case seems much harder to reach than the nearest neighbor algorithm. In the limit of 
* arbitrarily many subsets, each new addition or point moved by a deletion will be in a singleton 
* subset, and the algorithm will differ from nearest neighbors in only a couple of ways: (1) when we
* create the initial data structure, we use a conga line rather than all nearest neighbors, to keep 
* the in-degree of each point low, and (2) when we insert a point, we don't bother updating other 
* points' neighbors.
*
* Total space: 20n bytes. (Could be reduced to 4n at some cost in update time.)
* Time per insertion or single distance update: O(n)
* Time per deletion or point update: O(n) expected, O(n^2) worst case
* Time per closest pair: O(n)
